# Dublin Bike Stations

- **Back-End Web Development Assignment 1**

## Project Description

This project is a web application designed for displaying and managing information about Dublin bike stations. 
It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for seamless data handling and interactivity, along with the Google Maps API for geolocation features. 
The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to view a list of bike stations, search for specific stations, and see detailed information about each station on a map.

## Key Features:

- **Station List**: Displays all available bike stations with their names in a scrollable list. Users can click on a station to view more details.

- **Search Functionality**: An input field allows users to filter the list of stations by typing the station name, enabling quick access to specific stations.

- **Station Details**: Upon selecting a station from the list, detailed information about the station (such as available bikes and location) is displayed dynamically.

- **Map Integration**: The application utilizes the Google Maps API to show the selected station's location on a map, enhancing user experience and providing geographical context.

- **Data Source**: The project uses a JSON file provided by the lecturer, containing structured data about the bike stations, to populate the application dynamically.
